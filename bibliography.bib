  abstract = {Inosine is a nucleotide resulting from the deamination of adenosine in RNA. This chemical modification process, known as RNA editing, is typically mediated by a family of double-stranded RNA binding proteins named Adenosine Deaminase Acting on dsRNA (ADAR). While the presence of ADAR orthologs has been traced throughout the evolution of metazoans, the existence and extension of RNA editing have been characterized in a more limited number of animals so far. Undoubtedly, ADAR-mediated RNA editing plays a vital role in physiology, organismal development and disease, making the understanding of the evolutionary conservation of this phenomenon pivotal to a deep characterization of relevant biological processes. However, the lack of direct high-throughput methods to reveal RNA modifications at single nucleotide resolution limited an extended investigation of RNA editing. Nowadays, these methods have been developed, and appropriate bioinformatic pipelines are required to fully exploit this data, which can complement existing approaches to detect ADAR editing. Here, we review the current literature on the ``bioinformatics for inosine'' subject and we discuss future research avenues in the field.},

Increasing evidence have shown that adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing can potentially rendering substantial functional effects throughout the genome. Using RNA editing datasets from two large consortiums: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we quantitatively analyzed human genome-wide RNA editing events derived from tumor or normal tissues. Generally, a common RNA editing site tends to have a higher editing level in tumors as compared to normal samples. Of the 14 tumor-normal-paired cancer types examined, Eleven of the 14 cancers tested had overall increased RNA editing levels in the tumors. The editomes in cancer or normal tissues were dissected by genomic locations, and significant RNA editing locational difference was found between cancerous and healthy subjects. Additionally, our results indicated a significant correlation between the RNA editing rate and the gene density across chromosomes, highlighted hyper RNA editing clusters through visualization of running RNA editing rates along chromosomes, and identified hyper RNA edited genes (protein-coding genes, lincRNAs, and pseudogenes) that embody a large portion of cancer prognostic predictors. This study reinforces the potential functional effects of RNA editing in protein-coding genes, and also makes a strong foundation for further exploration of RNA editing's roles in non-coding regions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

On the other hand, cytidine to uridine (C-To-U) editors, members of the AID/APOBEC family, are heavily implicated in innate and adaptive immunity with important roles in antibody diversification and antiviral response. Physiologically, these enzymes are present in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm, where they modify various RNA molecules, including miRNAs, tRNAs apart from mRNAs, whereas DNA editing is also possible by some of them. The expansion of next generation sequencing technologies provided a wealth of data regarding such modifications. RNA editing has been implicated in various disorders including cancer, and neurological diseases of the brain or the central nervous system. It is also related to cancer heterogeneity and the onset of carcinogenesis. Response to treatment can also be affected by the RNA editing status where drug efficacy is significantly compromised.

Mutations in ADAR1, an adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme of dsRNA, cause Aicardi-Gouti{\`e}res syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder associated with spontaneous interferon production and neurologic sequelae. We generated ADAR1 knockout human cells to explore ADAR1 substrates and function. ADAR1 primarily edited Alu elements in RNA polymerase II (pol II)-transcribed mRNAs, but not putative pol III-transcribed Alus. During the IFN response, ADAR1 blocked translational shutdown by inhibiting hyperactivation of PKR, a dsRNA sensor. ADAR1 dsRNA binding and catalytic activities were required to fully prevent endogenous RNA from activating PKR. Remarkably, ADAR1 knockout neuronal progenitor cells exhibited MDA5 (dsRNA sensor)-dependent spontaneous interferon production, PKR activation, and cell death. Thus, human ADAR1 regulates sensing of self versus nonself RNA, allowing pathogen detection while avoiding autoinflammation. The human RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 prevents endogenous RNA from activating innate immune sensors (PKR, MDA5), which allows efficient translation during IFN response.},

Here, we characterize the A-to-I RNA editome of honeybees (Apis mellifera), identifying 407 high-confidence A-to-I editing sites. Editing is most abundant in the heads and shows signatures for positive selection. Editing behavior differs between foragers and nurses, suggesting a role for editing in caste differentiation. Although only five sites are conserved between bees and flies, an unexpectedly large number of genes exhibit editing in both species, albeit at different locations, including the nonsynonymous auto-editing of Adar. This convergent evolution, where the same target genes independently acquire recoding events in distant diverged clades, together with the signals of adaptation observed in honeybees alone, further supports the notion of recoding being adaptive.},

RNA editing is unique among these modifications because it not only alters the cellular fate of RNA molecules but also alters their sequence relative to the genome. The most common type of RNA editing is A-to-I editing by double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes. Recent transcriptomic studies have identified a number of 'recoding' sites at which A-to-I editing results in non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding sequences. Many of these recoding sites are conserved within (but not usually across) lineages, are under positive selection and have functional and evolutionary importance. However, systematic mapping of the editome across the animal kingdom has revealed that most A-to-I editing sites are located within mobile elements in non-coding parts of the genome. Editing of these non-coding sites is thought to have a critical role in protecting against activation of innate immunity by self-transcripts. Both recoding and non-coding events have implications for genome evolution and, when deregulated, may lead to disease. Finally, ADARs are now being adapted for RNA engineering purposes.},

These advances have significantly enhanced the understanding of mechanisms involved in development and in homeostasis. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that RNA editing may be critically involved in cancer, aging, neurological, autoimmune, or cardiovascular diseases.

However, one must exercise caution when searching for editing sites, as A-to-G conversions also arise from sequencing errors as well as mutations. To address these complexities, several algorithms and software products have been developed to accurately identify editing events. Here, we survey currently available methods to analyze RNA editing events and introduce a new easy-to-use bioinformatics tool 'RNAEditor' for the detection of RNA editing events. During the development of RNAEditor, we noticed editing often happened in clusters, which we named 'editing islands'. We developed a clustering algorithm to find editing islands and included it in RNAEditor.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, the most prevalent type of RNA editing in metazoans, is carried out by adenosine deaminases (ADARs) in double-stranded RNA regions. Several computational approaches have been recently developed to identify A-to-I RNA editing sites from sequencing data, each addressing a particular issue. Here, we present RNA Editing Sites Identification and Classification (RESIC), an efficient pipeline that combines several approaches for the detection and classification of RNA editing sites. The pipeline can be used for all organisms and can use any number of RNA-sequencing datasets as input. RESIC provides (1) the detection of editing sites in both repetitive and non-repetitive genomic regions; (2) the identification of hyper-edited regions; and (3) optional exclusion of polymorphism sites to increase reliability, based on DNA, and ADAR-mutant RNA sequencing datasets, or SNP databases. We demonstrate the utility of RESIC by applying it to human, successfully overlapping and extending the list of known putative editing sites. We further tested changes in the patterns of A-to-I RNA editing, and RNA abundance of ADAR enzymes, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines. Our results suggest that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to mock, the number of hyper editing sites is increased, and in agreement, the activity of ADAR1, which catalyzes hyper-editing, is enhanced. These results imply the involvement of A-to-I RNA editing in conceiving the unpredicted phenotype of COVID-19 disease. RESIC code is open-source and is easily extendable.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {RNA editing, the post-transcriptional alteration of a gene-encoded sequence, is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes. As a consequence of RNA editing, functionally distinct proteins can be produced from a single gene. The molecular mechanisms involved include single or multiple base insertions or deletions as well as base substitutions. In mammals, one type of substitutional RNA editing, characterized by site-specific base-modification, was shown to modulate important physiological processes. The underlying reaction mechanism of substitutional RNA editing involves hydrolytic deamination of cytosine or adenosine bases to uracil or inosine, respectively. Protein factors have been characterized that are able to induce RNA editing in vitro. A supergene family of RNA-dependent deaminases has emerged with the recent addition of adenosine deaminases specific for tRNA. Here we review the developments that have substantially increased our understanding of base-modification RNA editing over the past few years, with an emphasis on mechanistic differences, evolutionary aspects and the first insights into the regulation of editing activity.

This chapter focuses on the functional implications of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in both short (e.g., miRNAs) and long ncRNAs. RNA editing dynamically alters the sequence and structure of primary transcripts, impacting ncRNA biogenesis and function. Notable findings include the role of miRNA editing in promoting glioblastoma invasiveness, characterizing RNA editing hotspots across cancers, and its implications in thyroid cancer and ischemia. This chapter also highlights bioinformatics resources and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that enable comprehensive ncRNAome studies and genome-wide RNA editing detection. Dysregulation of RNA editing machinery has been linked to various human diseases, emphasizing the potential of RNA editing as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

  abstract = {RNA, like DNA and proteins, can undergo modifications. To date, over 170 RNA modifications have been identified, leading to the emergence of a new research area known as epitranscriptomics. RNA editing is the most frequent RNA modification in mammalian transcriptomes, and two types have been identified: (1) the most frequent, adenosine to inosine (A-to-I); and (2) the less frequent, cysteine to uracil (C-to-U) RNA editing. Unlike other epitranscriptomic marks, RNA editing can be readily detected from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data without any chemical conversions of RNA before sequencing library preparation. Furthermore, analyzing RNA editing patterns from transcriptomic data provides an additional layer of information about the epitranscriptome. As the significance of epitranscriptomics, particularly RNA editing, gains recognition in various fields of biology and medicine, there is a growing interest in detecting RNA editing sites (RES) by analyzing RNA-seq data. To cope with this increased interest, several bioinformatic tools are available. However, each tool has its advantages and disadvantages, which makes the choice of the most appropriate tool for bench scientists and clinicians difficult. Here, we have benchmarked bioinformatic tools to detect RES from RNA-seq data. We provide a comprehensive view of each tool and its performance using previously published RNA-seq data to suggest recommendations on the most appropriate for utilization in future studies.},

  abstract = {Inosine is a prevalent RNA modification in animals and is formed when an adenosine is deaminated by the ADAR family of enzymes. Traditionally, inosines are identified indirectly as variants from Illumina RNA-sequencing data because they are interpreted as guanosines by cellular machineries. However, this indirect method performs poorly in protein-coding regions where exons are typically short, in non-model organisms with sparsely annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or in disease contexts where unknown DNA mutations are pervasive. Here, we show that Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing can be used to identify inosine-containing sites in native transcriptomes with high accuracy. We trained convolutional neural network models to distinguish inosine from adenosine and guanosine, and to estimate the modification rate at each editing site. Furthermore, we demonstrated their utility on the transcriptomes of human, mouse and Xenopus. Our approach expands the toolkit for studying adenosine-to-inosine editing and can be further extended to investigate other RNA modifications.},

Genetic variation contributes to RNA editing variability between individuals and has the potential to impact phenotypic variability. Results: We analyze matched genetic and transcriptomic data in 49 tissues across 437 individuals to identify RNA editing events that are associated with genetic variation. Using an RNA editing quantitative trait loci (edQTL) mapping approach, we identify 3117 unique RNA editing events associated with a cis genetic polymorphism. Fourteen percent of these edQTL events are also associated with genetic variation in their gene expression. A subset of these events are associated with genome-wide association study signals of complex traits or diseases. We determine that tissue-specific levels of ADAR and ADARB1 are able to explain a subset of tissue-specific edQTL events. We find that certain microRNAs are able to differentiate between the edited and unedited isoforms of their targets. Furthermore, microRNAs can generate an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) signal from an edQTL locus by microRNA-mediated transcript degradation in an editing-specific manner. By integrative analyses of edQTL, eQTL, and microRNA expression profiles, we computationally discover and experimentally validate edQTL-microRNA pairs for which the microRNA may generate an eQTL signal from an edQTL locus in a tissue-specific manner. Conclusions: Our work suggests a mechanism in which RNA editing variability can influence the phenotypes of complex traits and diseases by altering the stability and steady-state level of critical RNA molecules.},

After reviewing 55 studies, it highlights significant methodological heterogeneity, hindering result comparability and reproducibility. To address this, we developed a2iHelper, a Python package that streamlines RNA editing analysis by filtering noise, performing statistical analyses, and generating visualizations. a2iHelper integrates seamlessly with Python machine learning tools, aiming to standardize and simplify RNA editing research. Results We applied our methods to analyze A-to-I editing in a public dataset comparing wild-type and ADAR knockout. The source code is open, freely available on GitHub, and organized in a well-documented Python package. Using Snakemake for preprocessing, we conducted differential editing analysis on the top 104 most edited genes. The results include p-values from statistical tests, Odds ratios for Manhattan plots, and correlations between editing frequencies and gene expression, visualized in various plots. Conclusions We developed a2iHelper, a Python-based package for analyzing and visualizing A-to-I RNA editing data. It allows researchers with minimal programming experience to perform organized, reproducible editing analyses. Novice users can easily detect editing sites, filter noise, and generate figures, while advanced users can integrate functionalities into their workflows. a2iHelper runs on personal computers without needing High-Performance Computing resources.},

This study introduces a novel methodology leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically OpenAI's GPT-3.5, to predict both the occurrence and efficiency of RNA editing by base editors such as ADAR enzymes. By fine-tuning GPT models on extensive datasets of RNA sequences and secondary structures, we observe improvements in predictive accuracy, with our approach outperforming existing approaches. Our approach involves framing the problem in two distinct ways: as a generation problem, predicting new edited structures, and as a classification problem, determining if specific sites are edited. We also implement robust data augmentation strategies and threshold adjustments to optimize the model's performance. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GPT in solving complex biological problems, providing a robust framework for future genetic interventions.

Such RNA sequence differences between mature transcript and encoding genome represent a form of genetic recoding.

  abstract = {Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process by which adenosines are selectively converted to inosines in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. A highly conserved group of enzymes, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, mediates this reaction. All ADARs share a common domain architecture consisting of a variable number of amino-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a carboxy-terminal catalytic deaminase domain. ADAR family members are highly expressed in the metazoan nervous system, where these enzymes predominantly localize to the neuronal nucleus. Once in the nucleus, ADARs participate in the modification of specific adenosines in pre-mRNAs of proteins involved in electrical and chemical neurotransmission, including pre-synaptic release machineries, and voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Most RNA editing sites in these nervous system targets result in non-synonymous codon changes in functionally important, usually conserved, residues and RNA editing deficiencies in various model organisms bear out a crucial role for ADARs in nervous system function. Mutation or deletion of ADAR genes results in striking phenotypes, including seizure episodes, extreme uncoordination, and neurodegeneration. Not only does the process of RNA editing alter important nervous system peptides, but ADARs also regulate gene expression through modification of dsRNA substrates that enter the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and may then act at the chromatin level. Here, we present a review on the current knowledge regarding the ADAR protein family, including evolutionary history, key structural features, localization, function and mechanism.},

  abstract = {A-to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification that converts adenosines to inosines in both coding and noncoding RNA transcripts. It is catalyzed by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes, which exist throughout the body but are most prevalent in the central nervous system. Inosines exhibit properties that are most similar to those of guanosines. As a result, ADAR-mediated editing can post-transcriptionally alter codons, introduce or remove splice sites, or affect the base pairing of the RNA molecule with itself or with other RNAs. A-to-I editing is a mechanism that regulates and diversifies the transcriptome, but the full biological significance of ADARs is not understood. ADARs are highly conserved across vertebrates and are essential for normal development in mammals. Aberrant ADAR activity has been associated with a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, viral infections and autoimmune disorders. ADARs have been shown to contribute to disease pathologies by editing of glutamate receptors, editing of serotonin receptors, mutations in ADAR genes, and by other mechanisms, including recently identified regulatory roles in microRNA processing. Advances in research into many of these diseases may depend on an improved understanding of the biological functions of ADARs. Here, we review recent studies investigating connections between ADAR-mediated RNA editing and human diseases. {\copyright} 2013 BioMed Central Ltd.}

  abstract = {ConspectusAdenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes of which there are three members (ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3), is a major gene regulatory mechanism that diversifies the transcriptome. It is widespread in many metazoans, including humans. As inosine is interpreted by cellular machineries mainly as guanosine, A-to-I editing effectively gives A-to-G nucleotide changes. Depending on its location, an editing event can generate new protein isoforms or influence other RNA processing pathways. Researchers have found that ADAR-mediated editing performs diverse functions. For example, it enables living organisms such as cephalopods to adapt rapidly to fluctuating environmental conditions such as water temperature. In development, the loss of ADAR1 is embryonically lethal partly because endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are no longer marked by inosines, which signal ``self'', and thus cause the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) sensor to trigger a deleterious interferon response. Hence, ADAR1 plays a key role in preventing aberrant activation of the innate immune system. Furthermore, ADAR enzymes have been implicated in myriad human diseases. Intriguingly, some cancer cells are known to exploit ADAR1 activity to dodge immune responses. However, the exact identities of immunogenic RNAs in different biological contexts have remained elusive. Consequently, there is tremendous interest in identifying inosine-containing RNAs in the cell.The identification of A-to-I RNA editing sites is dependent on the sequencing of nucleic acids. Technological and algorithmic advancements over the past decades have revolutionized the way editing events are detected. At the beginning, the discovery of editing sites relies on Sanger sequencing, a first-generation technology. Both RNA, which is reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA), and genomic DNA (gDNA) from the same source are analyzed. After sequence alignment, one would require an adenosine to be present in the genome but a guanosine to be detected in the RNA sample for a position to be declared as an editing site. However, an issue with Sanger sequencing is its low throughput. Subsequently, Illumina sequencing, a second-generation technology, was invented. By permitting the simultaneous interrogation of millions of molecules, it enables many editing sites to be identified rapidly. However, a key challenge is that the Illumina platform produces short sequencing reads that can be difficult to map accurately. To tackle the challenge, we and others developed computational workflows with a series of filters to discard sites that are likely to be false positives. When Illumina sequencing data sets are properly analyzed, A-to-G variants should emerge as the most dominant mismatch type. Moreover, the quantitative nature of the data allows us to build a comprehensive atlas of editing-level measurements across different biological contexts, providing deep insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA editing. However, difficulties remain in identifying true A-to-I editing sites in short protein-coding exons or in organisms and diseases where DNA mutations and genomic polymorphisms are prevalent and mostly unknown. Nanopore sequencing, a third-generation technology, promises to address the difficulties, as it allows native RNAs to be sequenced without conversion to cDNA, preserving base modifications that can be directly detected through machine learning. We recently demonstrated that nanopore sequencing could be used to identify A-to-I editing sites in native RNA directly. Although further work is needed to enhance the detection accuracy in single molecules from fewer cells, the nanopore technology holds the potential to revolutionize epitranscriptomic studies.}

These models are applicable to samples from either single individuals or a pool of multiple individuals if the ploidy information is known. In addition, RES-Scanner implements statistical tests to distinguish genuine RNA-editing sites from sequencing errors, and provides a series of sophisticated filtering options to remove false positives resulting from mapping errors. Finally, RES-Scanner can improve the completeness and accuracy of editing site identification when the data of multiple samples are available.RES-Scanner, as a software package written in the Perl programming language, provides a comprehensive solution that addresses read mapping, homozygous genotype calling, de novo RNA-editing site identification and annotation for any species with matching RNA-seq and DNA-seq data.

While recent high-throughput approaches have provided comprehensive documentation of the RNA editome, its functional output remains mostly unresolved, particularly for events in the non-coding regions. Gene ontology analysis of the known RNA editing targets unveiled a preponderance of genes related to apoptosis regulation, among which proto-oncogenes XIAP and MDM2 encode two the most abundantly edited transcripts. To further decode this potential functional connection, here we showed that the main RNA editor ADAR1 directly targets this 3' UTR editing of XIAP and MDM2, and further exerts a negative regulation on the expression of their protein products. This post-transcriptional silencing role was mediated via the inverted Alu elements in the 3' UTR but independent of alteration in transcript stability or miRNA targeting. Rather, we discovered that ADAR1 competes transcript occupancy with the RNA shuttling factor STAU1 to facilitate nuclear retention of the XIAP and MDM2 mRNAs. As a consequence, ADAR1 may acquire functionality in part by conferring spatial distribution and translation efficiency of the target transcripts. Finally, abrogation of ADAR1 expression or catalytic activity elicited a XIAP-dependent suppression of apoptotic response, whereas ectopic expression reversed this protective effect on cell death. Together, our results extended the known functions of ADAR1 and RNA editing to the critical fine-tuning of the intracellular apoptotic signaling and also provided mechanistic explanation for ADAR1's roles in development and tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides single-nucleotide information that makes it a powerful tool for prediction of RNA editome. A new method, GIREMI, predicts RNA editomes (mainly A-to-I editing) accurately and sensitively using a single RNA-Seq data set, which does not require sample-specific genome sequence data or high sequencing depth. Using GIREMI, we observed prevailing tissue-specificity of RNA editing and interesting evolutionary patterns of editing sites in human population.},

  abstract = {RNA editing generates post-transcriptional sequence alterations. Detection of RNA editing sites (RESs) typically requires the filtering of SNVs called from RNA-seq data using an SNP database, an obstacle that is difficult to overcome for most organisms.Here, we present a novel method named SPRINT that identifies RESs without the need to filter out SNPs. SPRINT also integrates the detection of hyper RESs from remapped reads, and has been fully automated to any RNA-seq data with reference genome sequence available. We have rigorously validated SPRINT's effectiveness in detecting RESs using RNA-seq data of samples in which genes encoding RNA editing enzymes are knock down or over-expressed, and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. We have applied SPRINT to investigate RNA editing across tissues and species, and also in the development of mouse embryonic central nervous system. A web resource (http://sprint.tianlab.cn) of RESs identified by SPRINT has been constructed.The software and related data are available at http://sprint.tianlab.cn.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}
